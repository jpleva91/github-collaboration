	<h1>Welcome to my awesome site!</h1>
	<h3>A sweet sub header</h3>

	Your failures are your own, old man! I say, follow throooough! Yea. If you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty. Nice, Mrs Pancakes. Real nice. Nice to wheat you!

	We're gonna nine eleven this bitch unless Morty gets better math grades! Looks like some sort of legally safe knockoff of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives! Me irresponsible? All I wanted was for you to hand me a screwdriver! But instead you had me buckle down and make you a roofie juice serum, so you can roofie that poor girl at your school. W-w-w-w--are you kidding me, Morty?! You're really gonna try to take the high road on this one? Y'know your-you're a little creep, Morty! Your-your-your-you're just a little creepy creep person! God? God's turning people into insect monsters Beth. I'm the one beating them to death. Thank me.

	I'm not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe? Your failures are your own, old man! I say, follow throooough! Shut the fuck up about moonmen! It's not like we can do this every week, we get 3 or 4 more of these tops.

	You know my name, that's disarming. Itâ€™s a new machine. It detects stuff all the way up your butt. Grassss... Taste bad! Yea and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mothers ovaries!
